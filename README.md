Sure, let's walk through the program step by step:

The program starts by importing the necessary Scanner class and defining the Basic class.

The isvalidpassword method takes a password as an argument and contains your password validation logic based on the provided requirements.

In the main method, the program sets the initial value of isvalid to true. This flag will control whether the loop should continue prompting the user for a password.

The program enters a while loop that continues as long as isvalid is true. This loop is responsible for repeatedly asking the user for a password until a valid one is entered.

Within the loop, the program displays instructions for password requirements.

The program then prompts the user to enter a password using the Scanner class.

If the entered password passes the validation by calling the isvalidpassword method, the program prints "Password is valid" and sets isvalid to false, ending the loop.

If the entered password doesn't pass validation, the program prints "Invalid Password" and the loop continues, prompting the user for another password.

Once a valid password is entered, the loop ends, and the program prints "Program Ended!!". The Scanner is closed to release resources.

The program repeatedly asks the user for a password, validates it according to the specified rules, and only ends when a valid password is provided. It provides the user with feedback on whether their password meets the requirements and ensures that the user can't proceed until a valid password is entered.
